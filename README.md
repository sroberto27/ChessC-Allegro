# ChessC-Allegro
This was my try to create a chess game in C++ using allegro. Not a good result, but a good experience. To move a pice first left-click the pice to move then right-click the same pice the proceed to click in the desert position with right-click finally press left-click to finish the movement. some basic rules of chess are followed but some are not.
